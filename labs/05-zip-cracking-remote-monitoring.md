# Lab 05: Password Cracking a ZIP File with Remote Job Monitoring

**Category:** Password Attacks
**Tools:** John the Ripper, AnyDesk
**Environment:** Isolated VM, self-created archive

## Objective
Simulate a realistic long-running password attack and practice monitoring it remotely.

## Steps
1. Set up a password-protected ZIP file and extracted its hash.
2. Ran John the Ripper using both wordlist and incremental (brute-force) modes.
3. Since cracking can take hours, used AnyDesk to remotely connect to the Windows host running the job from my phone.
4. Monitored progress and could adjust or stop the attack without being at the machine.

## Findings
Combined wordlist and incremental modes to balance speed and coverage. Confirmed that remote access tools let an attacker (or, in this case, a researcher) manage long-running jobs unattended.

## Takeaway
Persistence plus weak passwords is a practical attack path. Reinforced the same lesson as Lab 04 from a different angle: password strength, not just encryption, is the real control that matters.
